The current project has two HTML files:

1.	default.html : where the first point is developed. The javascript code for this file is found in the folder js/default.js file.

2. 	PaintEditor : where the second point is developed. The javascript code for this file is found in the folder js/dragdop.js

PaitEditor just allows you to add three shapes.
